Lambda Expressions in Java 8

Lambda expressions offer a concise way to define anonymous methods within a single line of code. 
They are particularly useful when working with functional interfaces, which are interfaces that have exactly one abstract method.

Key Points:

Syntax: A lambda expression consists of three parts:
Parameters (optional): Enclosed in parentheses, separated by commas.
Arrow (->): Separates the parameters from the body.
Body: The code to be executed, which can be a single expression or a code block enclosed in curly braces ({}).
Benefits:

Conciseness: Lambda expressions can simplify code compared to traditional anonymous classes.
Improved Readability: They can enhance readability for short, well-defined functionalities.
Functional Programming: They enable a more functional programming style in Java.
Common Use Cases:

Collections Framework: Filtering, sorting, iterating, and transforming elements in collections.
Callbacks: Passing functionality as arguments to methods.
Event Handling: Defining event handlers succinctly.
